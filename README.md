TransitionsExample
==================

An exercise showing how to use custom interactive UIViewController transitions. After building the app 
you should be able to edge swipe from left to right to bring a new UIViewController onto the stack. 
Swiping from the right edge to the left should do this same (it doesn't right now).

TODOs:
------

- Fix back swiping
- Refactor CustomTransition class so it doesn't know about specific view controllers
- Simplify

Things I read along the way:
